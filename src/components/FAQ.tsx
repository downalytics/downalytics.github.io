          We use GitHub login <span className="font-semibold">only</span> to access your account details (username, email, avatar). We do <span className="font-semibold">not</span> request access to your code or private repositories.

        <li>Download counts for each GitHub release asset</li>
        <li>Referrer (where the download came from, when available)</li>

    question: "How does it work?",
    answer:
      "Downalytics provides you with a custom download URL that redirects to your GitHub release asset. This URL tracks the download and provides analytics without changing your existing GitHub releases.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to change my GitHub release URLs?",
    answer:
      "No, you don't need to change your existing GitHub release URLs. Downalytics generates a custom URL that you can use instead, which will redirect to your GitHub asset.",

  {
question: "Is the service reliable and available?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Downalytics is built on a reliable infrastructure with high availability and multi region deployment",
  },
  {
  question: "Do you store the binaries and serve them?",
    answer: "No, Downalytics does not store or serve your release binaries. We only provide a custom download URL that redirects to your GitHub release asset, allowing you to track downloads without hosting the files ourselves.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to change my GitHub releases?",
    answer:
      "No, you don't need to change your GitHub releases. Downalytics works by providing you with a custom download URL that redirects to your GitHub release asset and tracks the download.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own domain?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Paid plans let you use your own custom domain for download links, like get.yourdomain.com.",

    question: "Is there a free plan?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the Free tier lets you track one project using a downalytics.dev subdomain.",

    question: "How is my data stored?",
    answer:
